My hope with this website is to write about what I'm
learning about in the realm of protein science.
This will mainly involve things like new computational skills I've picked up, new subjects I've read
about, or interesting things I've been reading.
Currently, I'm trying to learn how to do structural bioinformatics and use these skills more in my
day to day research.
I'm also trying to learn how to computationally design proteins *de novo*.
So I hope you join me on this long journey of trying to keep up to date with the
state-of-the-art in the protein science field.
In general, my research interests mainly revolve around proteins and molecular evolution.
It fascinates me how proteins manage to perform the exquisite and specific tasks that we see in nature, all while following simple biophysical rules.
How did they evolve? How do some proteins fold so perfectly, while others can barely stay
folded long enough to work with in the lab? Can we design new proteins to do new
sorts of molecular wizardry?
I don't expect to answer those questions here in this blog. But maybe if I can answer some
smaller technical questions, like "how the hell do I run this Python script?", then maybe
at some point one can hope to answer those bigger questions.

## Bio
I'm a research officer based at Monash Uni in Melbourne Australia, where I'm currently researching various proteins
that extract energy from trace gases. I started out doing an undergraduate
degree in genetics at the
University of Western Australia. When I finished undergrad, I figured I wasn't ready to
embark on a PhD because I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I managed to
get work as a research assistant at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research
(Perth, Western Australia), where it turns out I had a knack for protein
biochemistry in the lab. Later on, I moved interstate after I managed to land an RA job at WEHI (Melbourne, Victoria) and did even more protein biochemistry work.
Melbourne is a good place to do science (especially protein science) and a good place to
live (at least in my opinion), so I'm planning to live here for life.
When I'm not in the lab or on the computer, I like to hang out with my wife and two dogs.
And sometimes, if there's time, get to read a book.
