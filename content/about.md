It fascinates me how proteins manage to perform the exquisite and specific tasks that we see in nature, all while following simple biophysical rules.
How did they evolve? How do some proteins fold so perfectly, while others can barely stay
folded long enough to work with in the lab? Can we design new proteins to do new
sorts of molecular wizardry? I enjoy learning as much as I can about these
sorts of topics. My hope with this website is to write about what I'm
learning about, such as new computational skills I've picked up, new subjects I've read
about, or books I've been reading. Currently, I'm trying to learn much more about protein design, and how to
setup the computational tools required for protein design.

## Bio
I'm a research officer based at Monash Uni in Melbourne Australia, where I'm currently researching various proteins
that extract energy from trace gases. I started out doing an undergraduate
degree in genetics at the
University of Western Australia. When I finished undergrad, I figured I wasn't ready to
do embark on a PhD just yet because I still didn't know what I wanted to do. I managed to
get work as a research assistant at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research
(Perth, Western Australia), where it turns out I had a knack for protein
biochemistry in the lab. Later on, I moved interstate after I managed to land an RA job at WEHI (Melbourne, Victoria) and did even more protein biochemistry work.
Melbourne is a good place to do science (especially protein science) and a good place to
live (at least in my opinion).
