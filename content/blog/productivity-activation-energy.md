Going into 2024, I thought it would be fun to write about how I like to think about being productive, and how to slowly become more productive.
The issue with being "productive" (however that's defined), is that it requires actually *doing* things, and doing things requires *energy*.
Not just physical energy (like for example, going to the gym regularly), but mental energy too.
Often times it's the mental energy, or even just the thought of all the mental energy we need to exert, that overwhelms us and prevents us from doing the task we know we should do.
This is partly why we tend to procrastinate about doing things. 

## The analogy of the activation energy barrier

![Ea](/images/productivity/Ea.jpg)

I've often thought of this mental energy as a sort of "activation energy" barrier as described in chemistry (symbolised as *E*<sub>a</sub>).
Let's say there's a chemical reaction where substrates react to form a higher energy product.
It's not enough for reaction to provide the same amount of energy stored in the final product, no,
the reaction must provide an excess amount of energy to overcome the reactions activation energy.

Extending this analogy to the subject of productivity, we are similarly as stubborn as a substrates of a chemical reaction.
We require "hidden" levels of energy to do something as simple as read a book, or write that manuscript we said we'd write.
And as is usually the case, we always underestimate the amount of effort it will take to do something so simple, and conversely,
we tend to overestimate the amount of energy we will have to do said task.

One of the solutions to this problem, both in chemistry and in daily life, is to lower the activation energy barrier (*E*<sub>a</sub><sup>$\prime$</sup>).
What this usually boils down to is doing small things to make our future life easier and overall less stressful/energy demanding.
I'm in no way a productivity God (there are many things I want to write but still haven't),
but overall I think my level of productivity is a lot better than it once was a decade ago!
What follows is some examples from my own experience where I've ended up "lowering the activation energy barrier" of certain tasks,
sometimes without realising it.

NOTE: After doing some Googling, it turns out the writer, James Clear, [has also written about](https://jamesclear.com/chemistry-habits) the concept of "activation energy" in terms of productivity. For whatever it's worth, I came up with this concept independently of James Clear! Great minds think alike I suppose. Or perhaps this idea is such a derivative one that everyone thinks of it...

## Lowering the productivity activation energy barrier in practice

### 1. Keep a planner

I swear by keeping a planner. Once a week (usually a Monday morning, or a Friday evening) I like to sit down and plan what I need to do each day of the coming work week. 
That includes scheduling time during certain parts of a day to do just the one task I hope to get done.
I find that once I've planned out my time, I no longer have to constantly try to remember what I need to do; I can just read what I said I needed to do instead of expending mental energy trying to remember what I need to do.

### 2. Just write it down

A very simple tip that I've had to learn the hard way, but now swear by: immediately write things down as soon as you need to.
This doesn't just include things to put on a "to do" list, this involves all work that I may one day need to remember.
As an example, I try to constantly write down small things I've learned about coding. 
Even if I think it's painfully obvious, I know myself, and I know that after taking some time off from coding for a couple of weeks I will have forgetten some painfully obvious things.
"How do I setup a new git repo and setup the ssh permissions again??", 
I find these little questions to be stressful, hence raising my mental activation energy barrier.
But if I've written down a list of instructions in a physical notebook, I know I can just reread that and get back up to speed.

Could I just as easily Google some questions that I need a refresher on?
Yes of course, but I personally find re-Googling something annoying and energy draining.
